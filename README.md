A personal portfolio built with Vue.js and Tailwind CSS showcasing my journey as a full-stack developer and machine learning enthusiast. Featuring stunning animations, modern design, and carefully crafted components to demonstrate both technical skills and creative development.

## **💻 Local Installation**

To run the project locally:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```


## **🌐 Custom Animation Engine**

A key feature of this portfolio is a custom animation engine located in `src/services`.
It synchronises animation updates with browser cycles, centralises event listeners, separates computation from rendering and computes only visible animations through a virtual bounding box system.


### **Animable Component Properties**

When instantiating an animable component within the service, the following properties can be declared.

**`domSection`**
The HTML element that must be visible in order for animations to be active.

**`enableAnimations`**
Defines how animations start. It is typically used to remove pause related CSS states or any manual start logic.

**`disableAnimations`**
Defines how animations stop. It can reapply pause styles or trigger any required cleanup.

**`prepareForAnimations`**
Handles the computation phase of the animation. This method is responsible for gathering data and preparing the state before frames are applied.

**`tick`**
Synchronises and applies the animation frame. This method runs during the animation loop and updates the DOM in a controlled and efficient way.


## **🤖 Deployment and Workflow**

The application is deployed through a CI/CD workflow on GitHub Pages.
Every commit merged into `main` automatically builds and updates the live version.


## **📔 Conventions**

In order to follow best practices and make the project easier to maintain, I followed the conventions below:

* Commit following the [Conventional Commits standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
* A lightweight [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) structure.
* All code changes go through pull requests. This allows me to review my work cleanly and maintain a structured workflow even as a solo developer.


## **🤝 Feedback and Collaboration**

Anyone is welcome to open an issue to report bugs, suggest enhancements or start a discussion. You can also reach out through any of the contact methods listed in the portfolio.


## **🛡 License**
